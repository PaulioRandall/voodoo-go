OPERAND := IDENTIFIER | NUMBER

Rule 0:
  Predicate:   The subject token does not match another rule.
  Consequence: Abandon parsing and generate an error.
Rule 1:
  Predicate:   The left node has no kind
               AND the subject token has the IDENTIFIER type.
  Consequence: Place the subject token in the left node
               AND assign the left node the IDENTIFIER kind.
Rule 2:
  Predicate:   The left node has the IDENTIFIER or UNION kind
               AND the subject token has the ASSIGNMENT type.
  Consequence: Place the subject token in the current node
               AND assign the current node the ASSIGNMENT kind.
Rule 3:
  Predicate:   The left node has the IDENTIFIER kind
               AND the current node has the ASSIGNMENT kind
               AND the subject token has the NUMBER type.
  Consequence: Place the subject token in the right node
               AND assign the right node the OPERAND kind.
Rule 4:
  Predicate:   The left node has the IDENTIFIER kind
               AND the subject token has the VALUE_DELIM type.
  Consequence: Place the subject token in the current node
               AND assign the current node the UNION kind.
